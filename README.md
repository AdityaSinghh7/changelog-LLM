# LLM-Powered Changelog Generator

A developer-focused tool that uses LLMs to automatically generate clean, structured changelogs from GitHub commit history. Built with OpenAI, GitHub OAuth, and Next.js App Router 
‚Äî it helps devs summarize recent changes and share them through a simple public-facing changelog viewer.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AdityaSinghh7/changelog-LLM
    cd changelog-generator
    ```

2. Install Dependencies  
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following values:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url (optional)  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_client_id  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_oauth_client_secret  
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret  
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Run the Development Server  
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Features

### üßë‚Äçüíª Developer-Facing Dashboard
- Sign in with GitHub
- Select public repositories (or use all)
- View all commits and auto-generated summaries
- Filter by:
    - Repository
    - Search keywords
    - Date ranges

### üåê Public Changelog Viewer
- Clean, paginated changelog display
- Summaries organized by repo and date range
- Bullet point summaries and commit links
- Filters and date selection included

### üîê Auth & Access
- GitHub OAuth with `login: ""` to allow switching accounts
- JWT sessions with GitHub access token stored
- Middleware-protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/api`)

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth using NextAuth, stores access token and GitHub username (`login`) in the JWT session.

2. **Fetching Commits:** After login, developers select repositories. The app fetches commit history across all branches using GitHub's API.

3. **Semantic Grouping:**  
   Commits are sent to `/api/embedding` where OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model converts them into vectors.  
   Using cosine similarity and repository boundaries to cluster similar commits into semantic groups.

4. **Changelog Summarization:**  
   Groups are sent to `/api/summarize` where each is processed by GPT-4o.  
   The LLM returns structured JSON containing:
    - A short title
    - Date range
    - Bullet-point summary
    - Commit links

5. **Streaming Summaries:**  
   The `/api/summarize` response is streamed line-by-line for faster rendering.  
   The UI renders each group as it arrives.

6. **Frontend Filters:**  
   Date range, repo, and keyword filters are applied client-side.  
   Caching avoids repeated LLM calls for similar filter queries.

## üß© Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 13+ App Router
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js + GitHub OAuth
- **AI:** OpenAI API (`text-embedding-3-large`, `gpt-4o`)
- **UI:** TailwindCSS + React
- **State:** React Hooks + localStorage cache
- **API:** GitHub REST API 

---

## üí° Design Choices

- **Streamed responses** for smoother UX when generating summaries
- **Cosine similarity + repo name** for lightweight semantic grouping
- **Date filter as YYYY-MM-DD** with improved UX via visible date inputs
- **Multi-account GitHub login** using `login: ""` to prompt GitHub OAuth flow again
- **Modular API routes** for embedding and summarization logic separation

---

## üìç Future Improvements

- Add user auth persistence (DB-backed)
- Make changelog publicly shareable with user-specific URLs
- Add private repo support with user token scopes
- Enable feedback on generated summaries
- ‚ö° **Future Optimizations**:
  - Implement async batching with OpenAI API to reduce summarization time
  - Use background workers (e.g. queue with Redis/Resend/BullMQ) to offload heavy summarization
  - Pre-generate changelogs on a cron job and cache them for quicker load
  - Optimize frontend rendering with streaming + skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
